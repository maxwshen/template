template

A blank project template meant to be cloned from git for any project. The goal is to provides a flexible and powerful framework that is simple to understand. The user can then simply "fill in the blanks" to quickly generate any data processing pipeline. 

The hope is to abstract away as many nitty-gritty implementation details as possible, making it easy to code each step in a pipeline as a blackbox. Time spent writing project or data specific code is maximized, while time spent writing the surrounding software engineering framework is minimized. This is useful for mixing and reordering processing steps in the master _runall script.

Main Features:
- Automatic project file management
  - Default input and output folders have a straightforward logical structure
- Plug-in-play dumb parallelization 
  - Input can be split by files, or by lines within each file
  - Sister output files from different threads are automatically combined
- Reproducibility-friendly
  - Intermediate data processing output is easily accessible
  - Single _runall.py script makes it easy to re-run the entire pipeline
  - Configuration files are saved for each unique run
  - Dependencies between pipeline steps are easily visualized
